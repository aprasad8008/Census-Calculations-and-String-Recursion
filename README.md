# Census-Calculations-and-String-Recursion
Program begins by asking the user for the name of the data file.
Asks the user for the name of a state. 
If the user enters a valid state name, program does the following:
- prints the name of the census division to which the state belongs
- finds all counties for that state in the data file
  (prints the names of those counties in the order in which they appear in the file)
- computes the population totals for the state 
  (adding up the per-year counts of all counties in that state) and prints the final totals.
